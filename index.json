Despite the significant progress in LSM research over the past two decades, several long-standing issues, such as uncertainties related to training samples and model selection, remain inadequately addressed in the literature. In this study, we employed a physically based susceptibility model, PISA-m, to generate four different non-landslide data scenarios and combine them with mapped landslides from Magoffin County, Kentucky, for model training. We utilized two Bayesian network model structures, Naïve Bayes (NB) and Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN), to produce LSMs based on regional geomorphic conditions. After internal validation, we evaluated the robustness and reliability of the models using an independent landslide inventory from Owsley County, Kentucky. The results revealed considerable differences between the most effective model in internal validation (AUC = 0.969), which used non-landslide samples extracted exclusively from low susceptibility areas predicted by PISA-m, and the models’ unsatisfactory performance in external validation, as manifested by the identification of only 79.1% of landslide initiation points as high susceptibility areas. The obtained results from both internal and external validation highlighted the potential overfitting problem, which has largely been overlooked by previous studies. Additionally, our findings also indicate that TAN models consistently outperformed NB models when training datasets were the same due to the ability to account for variables’ dependencies by the former.","tags":["Landslides","Negative Samples","Bayesian Network"],"title":"An Assessment of Negative Samples and Model Structures in Landslide Susceptibility Characterization Based on Bayesian Network Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MM Crawford","JM Dortch","HJ Koch","Y Zhu","WC Haneberg","Z Wang","LS Bryson"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1670198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691553880,"objectID":"b7f1c39a6f8575fdced52ae7f6203cc0","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/publication/crawford_2022_landslide_risk/","publishdate":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/crawford_2022_landslide_risk/","section":"publication","summary":"Rapidly changing remote sensing technologies (lidar, aerial photography, satellites) provide opportunities to improve regional-scale landslide risk mapping.

This paper focuses on the analysis of this experimental study to investigate strain localization effects on a subset of tests included in this database. Strain localization is defined here as associated with the non-homogeneous deformation process occurring in elastoplastic materials, including sands. Many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted during the last two decades to explore the characteristics of localization effects on sand, and to determine how these contribute to the failure mechanisms of specific sands. Under a triaxial compression condition, localization effects have been studied mainly with regard to particle kinematics and translational strain of the specimen’s displacement fields. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no 3D experimental kinematic analysis performed on sands to study the localization phenomena that can directly relate the impact of a specimen’s initial and boundary conditions to a failure mechanism during a triaxial test. In this paper, we introduce a full set of 3D kinematic operators under cylindrical coordinates to assess the boundary localization effects of deforming sand specimens under triaxial loading conditions. Furthermore, a set of experiments were carried out under varying experimental conditions to study the impact of variability in these localization effects. Results show that patterns of kinematic effects are quantifiable and can be used to assess likely failure-influencing factors, such as confining pressure, initial density, sample geometry, and sample heterogeneity, in the development of specific failure mechanisms. Spatio-temporal interdependencies between localization effects, such as the interactions between shear, expansion, and compaction bands observed during the specimen’s shearing process, were also studied. We therefore hypothesize that the proposed framework will serve as the basis for quantifying the uncertainty associated with the development of localization effects over the boundary of sand-deforming specimens.","tags":["Kinematics","3D DIC","Strain Localization"],"title":"Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Kinematic Phenomena Observed along the Boundary of Triaxial Sand Specimens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y Zhu","Z Medina-Cetina","AR Pineda-Contreras"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1647388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691553880,"objectID":"2d2835dd4867c527176dd76b08ca75a0","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/publication/zhu_2022_displacement_statistics/","publishdate":"2022-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu_2022_displacement_statistics/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper follows up on a reference paper that inspired MDPI’s Topic “Stochastic Geomechanics From Experimentation to Forward Modeling”, where global and local deformation effects on sand specimens are fully described from high resolution boundary displacement fields, and supported by its experimental database, which is open to the scientific community for further study. This paper introduces the use of spatio-temporal statistics from a subset of such an experimental database to characterize the specimens’ spatio-temporal displacement fields, populated by repeating a set of triaxial compression tests on drained, dry, vacuum-consolidated sand specimens, tested under similar experimentally controlled conditions. A three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) technique was used to measure the specimens’ boundary displacement fields throughout the course of shearing under axial compression. Spatio-temporal first- and second-order statistics were computed for different data dimensionality conditions (0D, 0D-T, 1D-T, 3D-T) to identify and characterize the dominant failure mechanisms across different testing specimens. This allowed us to quantify localization phenomena’s spatio-temporal uncertainty. Results show that the uncertainty captured along the deformation process across different dimensionality conditions can be directly associated with different failure mechanisms, including localization patterns, such as the onset and evolution of shear, compression, and expansion bands. These spatio-temporal observations show the dependencies between locally distinctive displacement regions over a specimen’s surface, and across different times during a specimen’s shearing process. Results of this work provide boundary spatio-temporal statistics of experimental evidence in sands, which sets the basis for the development of research on the numerical simulation of sand’s constitutive behavior.

However, it has been found that VS30  is not an appropriate proxy, because it does not reliably correlate with site response. Therefore, the VS30‐based National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program site maps may not capture regional site responses. In earthquake engineering, site resonance, which can be characterized by the fundamental mode with a site period (⁠Tf⁠) and its associated peak amplification (⁠A0⁠), is the primary site‐response concern. Mapping Tf and A0 is thus essential for accurate regional seismic hazard assessment. We developed a 3D shear‐wave velocity model for the Jackson Purchase Region of western Kentucky, based on shear‐wave velocity profiles interpreted from seismic reflections and refractions, mapped geologic units, and digital‐elevation‐model datasets. We generated shear‐wave velocity profiles at grid points with 500 m spacing from the 3D model and performed 1D linear site‐response analyses to obtain Tf and A0⁠, which we then used to construct contour maps for the study area. Our results show that Tf and A0 maps correlate with the characteristics of regional geology in terms of sediment thicknesses and their average shear‐wave velocities. We also observed a strong dependency of A0 on bedrock shear‐wave velocities. The mapped Tf and A0 are consistent with those estimated from borehole transfer functions and horizontal‐to‐vertical spectral ratio analyses at broadband and strong‐motion stations in the study area. Our analyses also demonstrate that the depth to bedrock (⁠Zb⁠) is correlated to Tf⁠, and the average sediment shear‐wave velocity (⁠VS‐avg⁠) is correlated to A0⁠. This implies that Zb and VS‐avg may be considered as paired proxies to parameterize site resonance in the linear‐elastic regime.","tags":["Site Responses","Geohazard","Earthquake"],"title":"Mapping Fundamental‐Mode Site Periods and Amplifications from Thick Sediments: An Example from the Jackson Purchase Region of Western Kentucky, Central United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1568073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691553880,"objectID":"9a71617472d44b2bf887c088da06bae0","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/publication/zhu_2019_dissertation/","publishdate":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhu_2019_dissertation/","section":"publication","summary":"Soil variability is a complex but ubiquitous phenomenon that derived from many sources of uncertainty. This inherent in-homogeneous behavior can affect the accurate estimation of soil strength and ideally should be fully characterized for informed decision making. However, in traditional geotechnical engineering survey, quantification of soil variability is not routinely performed and materials are collectively considered as a homogenous body. This knowledge gap is likely to inhibit the true understandings of variations in soil properties, and lead the practical design compromised to conservative parameter values. Despite rapid proliferation of sensing techniques having enabled us to collect more detailed deformational evidence, to the author's knowledge, no statistical characterization has been performed on full field measurements. This research introduces a spatio-temporal statistical characterization of boundary kinematic phenomena captured by 3D digital image correlation (DIC) method. The combined interpretation of the displacement and kinematic operators provides a unique uncertainty quantification on the deforming granular media. First, we introduce a multi-scale data ensemble populated from a series of nominally similar triaxial sand specimens. First- (marginal statistics) and second-order (correlation analysis) statistics are assessed on each data scenario. The results reveal that the presence of shear and expansion band can introduce deformation dependencies in space and time. Also, the uncertainty of deformation pattern is greatly affected by the variability of localization behaviors, which is started as early as hardening phase. Second, the complete set of 3D kinematic operators under the Cylindrical coordinates-for the first time-applied to the assessment of meso-scale kinematics manifested on triaxial specimens. Our results suggest the kinematic patterns during the course of compression are influenced by factors such as confining pressure, initial density, varying composition, among others. Further statistical analysis of kinematic fields shows that different localization effects can interact with each other as evolved in both space and time. The results shed much light on systematically recognizing prevailing deteriorating mechanisms as well as uncertainty distributions during the process of shearing. Finally, we include a case study of probabilistic calibration of a visco-elastoplastic model representing the rheological property of sandstone. This is aimed to showcase the methodology we will apply to uncertainty quantification of modeling heterogeneous material responses in our future work.","tags":["Dissertation","3D DIC","Uncertainty Quantification"],"title":"Spatio-Temporal Statistical Characterization of Boundary Kinematic Phenomena Observed on a Series of Triaxial Sand Specimens","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[08/2023]: CGG website has migrated from WP to Hugo platform.\n[08/2023]: Congratulations to Amir Mohammad and Jyleem Hollins completed their ten weeks Pathway to Temple STEM High School Research Program!\n","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691553880,"objectID":"f16fbd58616139583332c38b045fa1a7","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/news/news/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/news/","section":"news","summary":"List of news.\r\n","tags":[],"title":"News","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"[08/2023]: CGG website has migrated from WP to Hugo platform.\n[08/2023]: Congratulations to Amir Mohammad and Jyleem Hollins completed their ten weeks Pathway to Temple STEM High School Research Program!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691553880,"objectID":"ebfbd6ffa84596a48af488477be4dc0c","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/news/newslist/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/newslist/","section":"news","summary":"[08/2023]: CGG website has migrated from WP to Hugo platform.\n[08/2023]: Congratulations to Amir Mohammad and Jyleem Hollins completed their ten weeks Pathway to Temple STEM High School Research Program!","tags":null,"title":"","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Graduate Students Sahand Khabiri, Fall 2019 to present\rSahand Khabiri (he/his) is currently a PhD candidate studying at Temple University.

We will reproduce all relevant results by the following steps.\nThis tutorial starts from installing Python and PyOSP on your computer. If you are familiar with the installing process, please jumping into the section of downloading the dataset.\nInstall PyOSP We start from installing Python on your machine. Since PyOSP is installed through Conda environment, we recommend users install Python through conda environment as well. First, click the link below and download the latest version of Miniconda based on your OS.\nhttps://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\nAfter installing the Miniconde, user should be able to see the Anaconda prompt in the terminal. For example, if Windows is the using OS, searching and clicking the “Anaconda prompt” in the searching bar, it should open a terminal window such as:\nNow, we create a conda environment called env_pyosp, and install PyOSP in it. Entering following commends line by line:\nconda create -n env_pyosp conda activate env_pyosp conda config --env --add channels conda-forge conda config --env --set channel_priority strict conda install python=3 pyosp After PyOSP installed, we can verify the installation by entering a Python shell (type python in the terminal window), and then check:\nimport pyosp print(pyosp.__version__) 0.1.6\rQuit the Python shell by pressing Ctrl-Z and then Enter.\nWe also recommend install Jupyter Notebook for the analysis, run the commend below in the terminal:\nconda install jupyterlab\nAfter you have installed the Jupyter Notebook on your computer, you can start the notebook server by running:\njupyter notebook\nWhen the notebook opens in your browser, you will see the level of directory containing notebooks. Now we can create a new folder (from the new button on the top right of page) for our analysis, rename it as ‘pyosp_teton’, and then enter the new folder. In the new folder, you can click the new button again, select Python 3, it will open a new notebook, such as below:\nBy entering the notebook, we can start our analysis.\nDownload the datasets You will need to download the GeoRaster and baseline shapefile for the swath analysis. In the terminal, cd to the folder ‘pyosp_teton’ that we created above, and input:\ngit clone https://github.com/PyOSP-devs/pyosp-case-studies.git\nIt will download datasets for this analysis.\nBasic swath analysis In the jupyter notebook, input follwing code snippet:\nimport pyosp baseline = \u0026#39;./pyosp-case-studies/teton/baseline.shp\u0026#39; raster = \u0026#39;./pyosp-case-studies/teton/teton_dem.tif\u0026#39; orig = pyosp.Orig_curv( baseline, raster, width=100000, line_stepsize=1000, cross_stepsize=10 ) Processing: [#########################] 68 of 68 lineSteps\rAfter the processing bar go through the end, a swath object orig should be generated. Before we move to the swath results, let’s take a look at baseline swath polygon, and swath polyline objects.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt from pyosp import read_shape # read the baseline shape line_shape = read_shape(baseline) lx, ly = line_shape.xy # Plot the swath polygon fig, ax = plt.subplots() swath_polygon = orig.out_polygon() px, py = swath_polygon.exterior.xy ax.plot(px, py) ax.plot(lx, ly, color=\u0026#39;C3\u0026#39;, label=\u0026#34;Baseline\u0026#34;) ax.set_aspect(\u0026#39;equal\u0026#39;, adjustable=\u0026#39;box\u0026#39;) ax.set_title(\u0026#34;Swath polygon\u0026#34;) ax.legend() # Plot the swath profile lines fig, ax = plt.subplots() swath_polylines = orig.out_polylines() for line in swath_polylines.geoms: x, y = line.xy ax.plot(x, y, color=\u0026#39;C1\u0026#39;) ax.plot(lx, ly, color=\u0026#39;C3\u0026#39;, label=\u0026#34;Baseline\u0026#34;) ax.set_aspect(\u0026#39;equal\u0026#39;, adjustable=\u0026#39;box\u0026#39;) ax.set_title(\u0026#34;Swath profile lines\u0026#34;) ax.legend() \u0026lt;matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x2dd620c97c0\u0026gt;\rAs shown above, our sampling profile lines are bounded by the swath polygon rather than defined swath width 100,000. Because in this case, we used a customized shape associating with the structure of Teton Range to clip the DEM. And our objective is to characterize Teton Range within the structure area. Thus, we used an over-extended swath width 100,000 to ensure the profile line can reach the raster boundary. When PyOSP detected the data boundary of DEM, it will prevent the profile line extending to the nodata region. The resulted sampling data is exactly within the area of clip shape. Check the background information in the PyOSP paper PyOSP paper.\nTo plot the swath profile, simply run the method:\norig.profile_plot() Differential swath analysis In the paper, we show the ability of PyOSP to split swath results, which we term “differential swaths.” We used TPI = 0 during post-processing as a threshold to delineate the inflection of slope shape where topography changes from concave-down (TPI \u0026gt; 0) to convex up (TPI \u0026lt; 0). Thus, differential swaths enable the separation of topography via geomorphic processes, with positive and negative TPI representing erosional and depositional areas of the topography, respectively.\nWe plot reclassfied TPI\u0026gt;0 and TPI\u0026lt;0 …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691613746,"objectID":"efe46099d39d631824ca4a6e242e79fe","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/post/pyosp_case_teton/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pyosp_case_teton/","section":"post","summary":"The objective of this tutorial is to present the process of analysis shown in the PyOSP paper section 4.1.

The installation of PyOSP is introduced by the tutorial Topographic analysis of Teton Range, Wyoming, which will not be repeated here.\nTPI based swath analysis In this case study, we use TPI based swath method to characterize the Licking River. In the PyOSP paper Figure 9, we present the differences between TPI based and elevation based methods for identifying the river valley. In general, PyOSP classification of the Licking River Valley was successful using both TPI and elevation (Fig. 9c). However, elevation would not be an ideal classification criterion in valley settings with higher gradients, including a longer reach of the Licking River. A TPI value of 0, on the other hand, will remain the approximate midpoint (inflection point) of the valley slopes along a river’s entire length.\nimport pyosp baseline = \u0026#39;./pyosp-case-studies/licking/baseline.shp\u0026#39; raster = \u0026#39;./pyosp-case-studies/licking/licking_dem.tif\u0026#39; tpi = pyosp.Tpi_curv( baseline, raster, width=10000, tpi_radius=5000, max_tpi=0, line_stepsize=100, cross_stepsize=100 ) Processing: [#########################] 1123 of 1123 lineSteps\rtpi.profile_plot() Terrace correlation In this study, PyOSP post-processing capabilities were used to highlight the TPI based swath dataset in a way that accentuated terrace-tread signatures. To this end, the TPI swath area was categorized and filtered to incorporate only those elevation datapoints that also have a slope less than 5 degree, which were then used for a series of scatter-swath, cross-swath, and histogram analyses.\nScatter-swath import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np # swath data with slope less than 5 degree # see also: https://pyosp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyosp.curvsp.html#pyosp.curvsp.Base_curv.post_slope tpi_small = tpi.post_slope(max_val=5) distance = tpi_small[0] dat = tpi_small[1] fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7.25, 2.5)) for ind, d in enumerate(distance): y = dat[ind] x = np.repeat(d, len(y)) ax.scatter(x, y, s=0.5, color=\u0026#39;r\u0026#39;, alpha=0.1) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#34;Distance (ft)\u0026#34;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#34;Elevation (ft)\u0026#34;) ax.set_xlim([min(distance), max(distance)]) # ax.set_ylim([450, 750]) plt.tight_layout() In the figure above, the dark red clusters correspond to terrace tread elevations as we identified in the field. Details are presented in Figure 10 of PyOSP paper.\nCross-swath profiles Four cross-swath sections were selected to examine the topographic view of each area.\nAs we mentioned in the Teton case study, there are two ways to define the boundary of cross swath profile:\nSpecify the start and end points positions away from the starting point of baseline. Draw the points along the baseline, and then pass the shapefile of points to the function. In the documentation of PyOSP, there is a tutorial about application process of these two methods.\nhttps://pyosp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/cross_swath.html\nHere we choose the second method to define the cross-swath boundary, using the boundary points we drew on the baseline.\nfrom pyosp.util import point_coords, grouped # Read boundary coordinates bound = \u0026#39;./pyosp-case-studies/licking/BoundaryPoints.shp\u0026#39; bound_coords = point_coords(bound) # cross-post-processing colors = [\u0026#39;maroon\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;darkgreen\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;indigo\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;] titles = [\u0026#39;cross_1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cross_2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cross_3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cross_4\u0026#39;] ind = 0 fig, ax = plt.subplots(4, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(4, 7)) fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.2) for start, end in grouped(bound_coords): tpi.post_slope( max_val=5, start=start, end=end, ax=ax[ind], color=colors[ind], cross=True, swath_plot=True ) ax[ind].set_title(titles[ind], pad=2) ax[ind].set_xlabel(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) ax[ind].set_ylabel(\u0026#34;Elevation (feet)\u0026#34;) ax[ind].set_ylim(450,700) if ind == len(colors)-1: ax[ind].set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Distance from the baseline (feet)\u0026#39;) ind += 1 plt.tight_layout() C:\\Users\\yzh486\\Miniconda3\\envs\\env_pyosp\\lib\\site-packages\\pyosp\\curvsp\\base_curv.py:171: RuntimeWarning: All-NaN axis encountered\rmin_z = [np.nanmin(x) if len(x) \u0026gt; 0 else np.nan for x in z]\rC:\\Users\\yzh486\\Miniconda3\\envs\\env_pyosp\\lib\\site-packages\\pyosp\\curvsp\\base_curv.py:172: RuntimeWarning: All-NaN axis encountered\rmax_z = [np.nanmax(x) if len(x) \u0026gt; 0 else np.nan for x in z]\rC:\\Users\\yzh486\\Miniconda3\\envs\\env_pyosp\\lib\\site-packages\\pyosp\\curvsp\\base_curv.py:173: RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice\rmean_z = [np.nanmean(x) if len(x) \u0026gt; 0 else np.nan for x in z]\rC:\\Users\\yzh486\\Miniconda3\\envs\\env_pyosp\\lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\lib\\nanfunctions.py:1368: RuntimeWarning: All-NaN slice encountered\rr, k = function_base._ureduce(\rC:\\Users\\yzh486\\Miniconda3\\envs\\env_pyosp\\lib\\site-packages\\pyosp\\curvsp\\base_curv.py:171: RuntimeWarning: All-NaN axis encountered\rmin_z = [np.nanmin(x) if len(x) \u0026gt; 0 else np.nan for x in z] …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691613746,"objectID":"cc151c24c9e8b24a8abd27f6a926f9da","permalink":"https://yichuanzhu.github.io.git/post/pyosp_case_licking/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pyosp_case_licking/","section":"post","summary":"In this tutorial, we will show how to use PyOSP performing intelligent swath analysis towards fluvial system.
